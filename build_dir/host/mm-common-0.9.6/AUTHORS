The shared build infrastructure for the GNOME C++ bindings has been created
by Daniel Elstner <daniel.kitta@gmail.com> while working as a developer for
Openismus GmbH <http://www.openismus.com/>.  This work is based on the ideas
and prior work of many people involved with the GNOME C++ bindings project.

The libstdc++.tag Doxygen tag file shipped with mm-common has been created
by the authors of the GNU C++ library reference documentation available from
<http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/>.
