mm-common 0.9.6 (2012-10-07)

  * Dist .js files that doxygen now generates
    (Murray Cumming)
  * Use $(MMDOCTOOLDIR) instead of @MMDOCTOOLDIR@ in Doxyfile.in.
    (Kjell Ahlstedt) Bug #673984.
  * Make downloading tags optional.
    (Krzesimir Nowak)
  * Don't try to run tar by shell.
  * Don't use missing for making skeleton tarball.
    (Krzesimir Nowak)
  * Fix running doxygen when it is located at a path containing spaces
    (Armin Burgmeier) Bug #630051

mm-common 0.9.5 (2010-03-30)

  * Distribute doctools if non-empty parameter is passed to
  MM_CONFIG_DOCTOOL_DIR
  (Krzesimir Nowak) Bug #645836

mm-common 0.9.4 (2010-03-18)

  * Correct the installation of the mm-common-util.pc file.
  (Krzesimir Nowak) Bug #645080

mm-common 0.9.3 (2010-03-15)

  * Add an mm-common-util pkg-config file, to be used intead of
  of glibmm-2.4 to get the location of doctool .pl files, such
  as doc-install.pl.
  * MM_CONFIG_DOCTOOL_DIR(): Get the .pl files from mm-common's
  installed copy instead of from glibmm, which now doesn't install its own
  copy. Because this macro has been updated, there should be no need for
  any changes in other *mm modules due to the changes in glibmm or mm-common.
  * Allow use of GMMPROC_EXTRA_M4_DIR in configure.ac to tell gmmproc about
  extra -I arguments.
  For instance, use this in configure.ac:
  MM_PKG_CONFIG_SUBST([GMMPROC_EXTRA_M4_DIR], [--variable=gmmprocm4dir gtkmm-3.0])
  (Murray Cumming)
