   "...by imposing a tiny bit of order in a communication you are
   translating, you are carving out a little bit of order in the
   universe.  You will never succeed.  Everything will fail and come
   to an end finally.  But you have a chance to carve a little bit
   of order and maybe even beauty out of the raw materials that
   surround you everywhere, and I think there is no greater meaning
   in life."

             Donald L. Philippi, Oct 1930 - Jan 1993
