                _Summum Bonum_

    All the breath and the bloom of the
            year in the bag of one bee:
    All the wonder and wealth of the mine in
         the heart of one gem:
    In the core of one pearl all the shade and the
           shine of the sea:
    Breath and bloom, shade and shine, -- wonder,
        wealth, and -- how far above them --
          Truth, thats brighter than gem,
          Trust, that's purer than pearl, --
    Brightest truth, purest trust in the universe --
              all were for me
                 In the kiss of one girl.
        -- Robert Browning
