``Democracy will not come today, this year,
  nor ever through compromise and fear.
  I have as much right as the other fellow has
  to stand on my two feet and own the land.
  I tire so of hearing people say
  let things take their course,
  tomorrow is another day.
  I do not need my freedom when I'm dead.
  I cannot live on tomorrow's bread.
  Freedom is a strong seed
  planted in a great need.
  I live here, too.
  I want freedom just as you.''
    ``The Weary Blues'', Langston Hughes
