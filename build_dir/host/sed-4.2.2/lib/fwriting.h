/* Return true if the stream STREAM is opened write-only or
   append-only, or if the last operation on the stream was a write
   operation.  Return false if the stream is opened read-only, or if
   it supports reading and there is no current write operation (such
   as fputc).

   freading and fwriting will never both be true.  If STREAM supports
   both reads and writes, then:
     - both freading and fwriting might be false when the stream is first
       opened, after read encounters EOF, or after fflush,
     - freading might be false or true and fwriting might be false
       after repositioning (such as fseek, fsetpos, or rewind),
   depending on the underlying implementation.

   STREAM must not be wide-character oriented.  */
