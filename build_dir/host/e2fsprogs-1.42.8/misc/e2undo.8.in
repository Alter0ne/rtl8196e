.SH NAME
e2undo \- Replay an undo log for an ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B e2undo
[
.B \-f
]
.I undo_log device
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B e2undo
will replay the undo log
.I undo_log
for an ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem found on
.IR device .
This can be
used to undo a failed operation by an e2fsprogs program.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-f
Normally,
.B e2undo
will check the filesystem UUID and last modified time to make sure the
undo log matches with the filesystem on the device.  If they do not
match,
.B e2undo
will refuse to apply the undo log as a safety mechanism.  The
.B \-f
option disables this safety mechanism.
