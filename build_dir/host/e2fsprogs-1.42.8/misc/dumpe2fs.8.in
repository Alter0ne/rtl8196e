.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b
print the blocks which are reserved as bad in the filesystem.
.TP
.B \-o superblock=\fIsuperblock
use the block
.I superblock

This option is not usually needed except by a filesystem wizard who 
is examining the remains of a very badly corrupted filesystem.
.TP
.B \-o blocksize=\fIblocksize
use blocks of
.I blocksize
bytes when examining the filesystem.
This option is not usually needed except by a filesystem wizard who 
is examining the remains of a very badly corrupted filesystem.
.TP
.B \-f
force dumpe2fs to display a filesystem even though it may have some 
filesystem feature flags which dumpe2fs may not understand (and which
can cause some of dumpe2fs's display to be suspect).
.TP 
.B \-h
only display the superblock information and not any of the block
group descriptor detail information.
.TP
.B \-i
display the filesystem data from an image file created by 
.BR e2image ,
using

.TP
.B \-x
print the detailed group information block numbers in hexadecimal format
.TP
.B \-V
print the version number of 
.B dumpe2fs
and exit.

output.
