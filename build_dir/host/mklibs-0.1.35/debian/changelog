  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Fix FTBFS with gcc 4.7 due to missing <unistd.h> include (closes:
    #667282).

  [ Adam Conrad ]
  * Ignore claims of NEEDED *@ld-linux.so.3 symbols, as this completely
    confuses armhf's double linker situation, and doing so doesn't
    break armel (or anything else with a linker by that SONAME), as
    linkers are treated specially and copied anyway (LP: #984007)

    upload
  * The glibc soname on alpha is libc.so.6.1, not libc.so.6; special-case

  * Depend on libc6-pic | libc6.1-pic, for Alpha.

 -- Tollef Fog Heen <tfheen@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Oct 2002 14:55:03 +0200

mklibs (0.1.6) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * add -D, --no-default-libs switch to omit default lib path
  * find dynamic linker by looking at the INTERP header rather
    than assuming we can infer it from the libc version number.
    (closes: #155779)
  * Ensure that the dynamic linker is installed along with the small
    libs.  In the case of glibc, libc.so has calls into ld-linux.so
    (glibc dynamic linker) so mklibs will always install ld-linux.so
    when it resolves external references.  However, uClibc's libc
    doesn't call it's dynamic linker (ld-uClibc.so).  In that case
    we have to copy it in manually.
  * Make sure we install libs under their soname. (closes: #154169)

    seems like some older pythons doesn't like that syntax.
