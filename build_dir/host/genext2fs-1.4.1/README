genext2fs generates an ext2 filesystem as a normal (non-root) user.
It does not require you to mount the image file to copy files on it,
nor does it require that you become the superuser to make device nodes.

Please use the genext2fs-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list to
contact the developers and/or report bugs.

See the included INSTALL file for instructions on installing genext2fs.
