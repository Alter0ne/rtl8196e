  A new SCons release, 2.3.1, is now available
  on the SCons download page:

          http://www.scons.org/download.php

  This release adds several new features and fixes many issues,
  including a serious regression in linking (failure to re-link if
  linker options are changed).

  Here is a summary of the changes since 2.3.0:

  NEW FUNCTIONALITY

    - Add Pseudo command to mark targets which should not exist after
      they are built.
    - Add support for a readonly cache (--cache-readonly)
    - Added cyglink linker that uses Cygwin naming conventions for
      shared libraries and automatically generates import libraries.
    - Added optional ZIPROOT to Zip tool.

  DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY

    -

  CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY

    - DocBook tool can now output EPUB format
    - Allow multiple options to be specified with --debug=a,b,c
    - Update bootstrap.py so it can be used from any dir, to run
      SCons from a source (non-installed) dir.
    - Added release_target_info() to File nodes, which helps to
      reduce memory consumption in clean builds and update runs
      of large projects.
    - Print full stack on certain errors, for debugging.
    - Improve documentation for Textfile builder.

  FIXES

    - Stop leaking file handles to subprocesses by switching to using subprocess
      always.
    - Generally try harder to print out a message on build errors
    - Added a switch to warn on missing targets
    - Always print stats if requested
    - Check for 8.3 filenames on cygwin as well as win32 to make variant_dir work properly.
    - Make sure SharedLibrary depends on all dependent libs (by depending on SHLINKCOM)
    - Fixed the setup of linker flags for a versioned SharedLibrary
      under OpenBSD (#2916).
    - Improve error if Visual Studio bat file not found.
    - Allow Subst.Literal string objects to be compared with each other,
      so they work better in AddUnique() and Remove().
    - Fixed the handling of long options in the command-line
      parsing (#2929).
    - Fixed misspelled variable in intelc.py (#2928).
    - VS2012 & VS2010: Resolve initialization issues by adding path to reg.exe
      in shell used to run batch files.
    - MSVC Support: fixed defaulting TARGET_ARCH to HOST_ARCH. It should be
      None if not explicitly set.
    - MSVC: Fixed issue where if more than one Architectures compilers are
      detected, it would take the last one found, and not the first.
    - Fixed spelling errors in MAN pages (#2897).
    - Fixed description of ignore_case for EnumVariable in the
      MAN page (#2774).

  PACKAGING

    - No changes

  DEVELOPMENT

    - Count statistics of instances are now collected only when
      the --debug=count command-line option is used (#2922).
    - Test harness: fail_test() can now print a message to help debugging.
    - Require rpmbuild when building SCons package.
    - Replaced old SGML-based documentation toolchain with a more modern
      approach, that also requires less external dependencies (programs and
      Python packages). Added a customized Docbook XSD for strict validation of
      all input XML files.
