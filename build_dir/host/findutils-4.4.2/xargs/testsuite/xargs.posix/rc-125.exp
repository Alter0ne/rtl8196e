# The technique of using "kill $$" is unreliable.  For example,
# on MacOS X, the child just exits with a nonzero status.
# This works better but is harder to use in a DejaGnu test:
#   yes | xargs -I{} echo | true
# Part of the problem here of course is that the exit status of the 
# pipeline is the exit status of its last compinent.
#
# This problem is recorded as Savannah bug# 19969.
