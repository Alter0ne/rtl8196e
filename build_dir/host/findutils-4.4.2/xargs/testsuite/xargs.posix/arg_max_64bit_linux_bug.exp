# This is because Linux's execve implementation requires that the sum of
# the sizes of all argument string pointers not exceed 128K (the actual
# limit is ARG_MAX - sizeof (void*)).  The difference between 32- and
# 64-bit systems is because sizeof (void*) differs (4 vs. 8).
#
# Tue Nov 22 19:36:49 2005: Use 'true' rather than 'echo', otherwise the 
# differences in the value of ARG_MAX on various platforms will cause the 
# test to fail.
