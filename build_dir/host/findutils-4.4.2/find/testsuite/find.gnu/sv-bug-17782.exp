# Savannah bug #17782.
# While -execdir echo blah {} works, -execdir echo "blah {}" doesn't.
# The bug is that the ./ prefix is prepended to the argument containing the 
# braces, not to the expansion of the braces, so you get output like 
# ./blah foo
# instead of 
# blah ./foo
#
if { [ safe_path ] } {
    exec rm -rf tmp
    exec mkdir tmp
    exec touch tmp/foo
    find_start p { tmp -name foo -execdir echo "saw {}" \; }
    exec rm -rf tmp
}
