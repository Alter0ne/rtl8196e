* -fstype core dumps on sparc-sun-sunos4.1.3_U1 with gcc-2.95.2
This is on foxtrot.rahul.net.  dbx does not work on compiled find.
Perhaps gcc is installed incorrectly.  "find / -fstype ufs" core dumps
quickly.  cc works correctly.

* Speed of locate without "-i" option needs to be increased.

* Internationalization
** updatedb.sh should be internationalized

* Eliminate unnecessary strcpy calls in xargs.

* man pages for frcode, bigram, and code
Perhaps a better description in texi pages as well.

* Add option for find to sort output in lexical order for use for updatedb
olarsac@airfrance.fr (Olivier) made the following suggestion:

As I was running thru the code looking for the bug I wondered why the updatedb
has to use sort...
why not add an option to find that sorts the output in lexical order?
my point is:
- sort on a big list is costly (here we do locate on big big file system)
- find may (in theory) sort incrementally very easily by sorting only the current
directory entries before recursion


* large file problems
depcomp gets added by automake

* investigate _LIBC when used with TOLOWER and TOUPPER
_LIBC is used to determine whether TOLOWER should check isupper first.
Is there something better to check?  Alternatively, can tolower be
checked at run time to determine whether isupper should be called first.

* BeOS problems with multibyte
Bruno Haible reported problems with BeOS.

* Include example of use of updatedb in documentation.
Use something close to the Debian daily cron job.

* Supply example for time range commands for find.
