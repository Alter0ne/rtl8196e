Things to do before we call this 1.0:

- Add support for gettext 0.11.
- Write real documentation explaining, among other things,
  why we don't do real XML parsing.
- Fix --help and man pages for all the tools. They are quite
  inaccurate and they make Sven Neumann disrespect the entire
  package.

Other things to do:

- Support type lines inside POTFILES.in?
- Do real XML parsing.
- Add a tool to help convert all .po files to UTF-8?
