.SH NAME
quilt \\- tool to manage series of patches

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B quilt
[-h] command [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Quilt is a tool to manage large sets of patches by keeping track of the
changes each patch makes. Patches can be applied, un-applied, refreshed,
etc. The key philosophical concept is that your primary output is patches.

With quilt, all work occurs within a single directory tree. Commands can be
invoked from anywhere within the source tree. They are of the form
.B quilt cmd
similar to CVS, svn or git commands. They can be abbreviated as long as the specified
part of the command is unique. All commands print some help text with
.B quilt cmd -h.

Quilt manages a stack of patches. Patches are applied incrementally on top
of the base tree plus all preceding patches. They can be pushed on top of
the stack
.RB ( "quilt push" ),
and popped off the stack
.RB ( "quilt pop" ).
Commands are available for querying the contents of the series file
.RB ( "quilt series" ,
see below), the contents of the stack
.RB ( "quilt applied" , " quilt previous" , " quilt top" ),
and the patches that are not applied at a particular moment
.RB ( "quilt next" , " quilt unapplied" ).
By default, most commands apply to the topmost patch on the stack.

Patch files are located in the
.I patches
sub-directory of the source tree (see EXAMPLE OF WORKING TREE below). The
.I QUILT_PATCHES
environment variable can be used to override this location. When not
found in the current directory, that subdirectory is searched
recursively in the parent directories (this is similar to the way
.I git
searches for its configuration files). The
.I patches
directory may contain sub-directories. It may also be a symbolic link
instead of a directory.

A file called
.I series
contains a list of patch file names that defines the order in which patches
are applied. Unless there are means by which series files can be generated
automatically, it is usually provided along with a set of patches. In this
file, each patch file name is on a separate line. Patch files are identified
by path names that are relative to the
.I patches
directory; patches may be in sub-directories below this directory. Lines
in the series file that start with a hash character (#) are ignored.
You can also add a comment after each patch file name, introduced by a
space  followed by a hash character. When
quilt adds, removes, or renames patches, it automatically updates the series
file. Users of quilt can modify series files while some patches are
applied, as long as the applied patches remain in their original order.

Different series files can be used to assemble patches in different ways,
corresponding for example to different development branches.

Before a patch is applied (or ``pushed on the stack''), copies of all files
the patch modifies are saved to the
.RI .pc/ patch
directory. The patch is added to the list of currently applied patches
(.pc/applied-patches). Later when a patch is regenerated
.RB ( "quilt refresh" ),
the backup copies in
.RI .pc/ patch
are compared with the current versions of the files in the source tree using
GNU diff.

Documentation related to a patch can be put at the beginning of a patch
file.  Quilt is careful to preserve all text that precedes the actual patch
when doing a refresh. (This is limited to patches in unified format; see
.B diff
documentation).

The series file is looked up in the .pc directory, in the root of the source
tree, and in the patches directory.  The first series file that is found is
used. This may also be a symbolic link, or a file with multiple hard links.
Usually, only one series file is used for a set of patches, so the
patches sub-directory is a convenient location.

The .pc directory and its sub-directories cannot be relocated, but it can be
a symbolic link. While patches are applied to the source tree, this
directory is essential for many operations, including taking patches off the
stack
.RB ( "quilt pop" ),
and refreshing patches
.RB ( "quilt refresh" ).
Files in the .pc directory are automatically removed when they are
no longer needed, so there is no need to clean up manually.

.SH QUILT COMMANDS REFERENCE

@REFERENCE@

.SH COMMON OPTIONS TO ALL COMMANDS

.IP \"\\fB--trace\\fP\" 8

Runs the command in bash trace mode (-x). For internal debugging.

.IP \"\\fB--quiltrc\\fP file\" 8

Use the specified configuration file instead of ~/.quiltrc (or
/etc/quilt.quiltrc if ~/.quiltrc does not exist).  See the pdf
documentation for details about its possible contents.  The
special value \"-\" causes quilt not to read any configuration
file.

.IP \"\\fB--version\\fP\" 8

Print the version number and exit immediately.

.SH EXIT STATUS

The exit status is 0 if the sub-command was successfully executed, and
1 in case of error.

An exit status of 2 denotes that quilt did not do anything to complete
the command.  This happens in particular when asking to push when the
whole stack is already pushed, or asking to pop when the whole stack
is already popped.  This behavior is intended to ease the scripting
around quilt.

The patches/ directory is precious as it contains all your patches as
well as the order in which it should be applied.

The .pc/ directory contains some metadata about the current state of
your patch serie. Changing its content is not advised. This directory
can usually be regenerated from the initial files and the
content of the patches/ directory (provided that all patches were
regenerated before the removal).

.SH EXAMPLE

Please refer to the pdf documentation for a full example of use.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE

Upon startup, quilt evaluates the file .quiltrc in the user's home
directory, or the file specified with the --quiltrc option.  This file
is a regular bash script. Default options can be passed to any COMMAND
by defining a QUILT_${COMMAND}_ARGS variable.  For example,
QUILT_DIFF_ARGS="--color=auto" causes the output of quilt diff to be
syntax colored when writing to a terminal.

In addition to that, quilt recognizes the following variables:

.IP EDITOR 4

The program to run to edit files.  If it isn't redefined in the
configuration file, $EDITOR as defined in the environment will be used.

.IP LESS 4

The arguments used to invoke the pager.  Inherits the existing value
of $LESS if LESS is already set in the environment, otherwise defaults
to "-FRSX".

.IP QUILT_DIFF_OPTS 4

Additional options that quilt shall pass to GNU diff when generating
patches. A useful setting for C source code is "-p", which causes GNU diff
to show in the resulting patch which function a change is in.

.IP QUILT_PATCH_OPTS 4

Additional options that quilt shall pass to GNU patch when applying
patches.  For example, recent versions of GNU patch support the
"--reject-format=unified" option for generating reject files in unified
diff style (older patch versions used "--unified-reject-files" for that).

You may also want to add the "-E" option if you have issues with quilt
not deleting empty files when you think it should. The documentation of
GNU patch says that "normally this option is unnecessary", but when patch
is in POSIX mode or if the patch format doesn't allow to distinguish
empty files from deleted files, patch deletes empty files only if the
-E option is given. Beware that when passing -E to patch, quilt will
no longer be able to deal with empty files, which is why using -E is
no longer the default.

.IP QUILT_DIFFSTAT_OPTS 4

Additional options that quilt shall pass to diffstat when generating
patch statistics. For example, "-f0" can be used for an alternative output
format. Recent versions of diffstat also support alternative rounding
methods ("-r1", "-r2").

.IP QUILT_PATCHES 4

The location of patch files, defaulting to "patches".

.IP QUILT_SERIES 4

The name of the series file, defaulting to "series". Unless an absolute path
is used, the search algorithm described above applies.

.IP QUILT_PATCHES_PREFIX 4

If set to anything, quilt will prefix patch names it prints with their
directory (QUILT_PATCHES).

.IP QUILT_NO_DIFF_INDEX 4

By default, quilt prepends an Index: line to the patches it generates.
If this variable is set to anything, no line is prepended.  This is
a shortcut to adding --no-index to both QUILT_DIFF_ARGS and
QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS.

.IP QUILT_NO_DIFF_TIMESTAMPS 4

By default, quilt includes timestamps in headers when generating patches.
If this variable is set to anything, no timestamp will be included.  This
is a shortcut to adding --no-timestamps to both QUILT_DIFF_ARGS and
QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS.

.IP QUILT_PAGER 4

The pager quilt shall use for commands which produce paginated output. If
unset, the values of GIT_PAGER or PAGER is used.  If none of these variables
is set, "less -R" is used.  An empty value indicates that no pager should be
used.

.IP QUILT_COLORS 4

By default, quilt uses its predefined color set in order to be more
comprehensible when distiguishing various types of patches, eg.
applied/unapplied, failed, etc.

To override one or more color settings, set the QUILT_COLORS variable in
following syntax - colon (:) separated list of elements, each being of the
form <format name>=<foreground color>[;<background color>]

Format names with their respective default values are listed below,
along with their usage(s).
Color codes(values) are standard bash coloring escape codes.

.RS 4
.IP \\fBdiff_hdr\\fP 10
Used in 'quilt diff' to color the index line. Defaults to 32 (green).

.IP \\fBdiff_add\\fP 10
Used in 'quilt diff' to color added lines. Defaults to 36 (azure).

.IP \\fBdiff_mod\\fP 10
Used in 'quilt diff' to color modified lines. Defaults to 35 (purple).

.IP \\fBdiff_rem\\fP 10
Used in 'quilt diff' to color removed lines. Defaults to 35 (purple).

.IP \\fBdiff_hunk\\fP 10
Used in 'quilt diff' to color hunk header. Defaults to 33 (brown/orange).

.IP \\fBdiff_ctx\\fP 10
Used in 'quilt diff' to color the text after end of hunk header (diff --show-c-function generates this). Defaults to 35 (purple).

.IP \\fBdiff_cctx\\fP 10
Used in 'quilt diff' to color the 15-asterisk sequence before or after a hunk. Defaults to 33 (brown/orange).

.IP \\fBpatch_fuzz\\fP 10
Used in 'quilt push' to color the patch fuzz information. Defaults to 35 (purple).

.IP \\fBpatch_fail\\fP 10
Used in 'quilt push' to color the fail message. Defaults to 31 (red).

.IP \\fBseries_app\\fP 10
Used in 'quilt series' and 'quilt patches' to color the applied patch names. Defaults to 32 (green).

.IP \\fBseries_top\\fP 10
Used in 'quilt series' and 'quilt patches' to color the top patch name. Defaults to 33 (brown/orange).

.IP \\fBseries_una\\fP 10
Used in 'quilt series' and 'quilt patches' to color unapplied patch names. Defaults to 0 (no special color).

.RE
.RS 4
In addition, the \\fBclear\\fP format name is used to turn off special
coloring. Its value is 0; it is not advised to modify it.

The content of QUILT_COLORS supersedes default values. So the value
diff_hdr=35;44 will get you the diff headers in magenta over blue
instead of the default green over unchanged background. For that, add
the following content to ~/.quiltrc (or /etc/quilt.quiltrc):

.nf
  QUILT_DIFF_ARGS="--color"
  QUILT_COLORS='diff_hdr=35;44'

.SH AUTHORS

Quilt started as a series of scripts written by Andrew Morton
(patch-scripts). Based on Andrew's ideas, Andreas Gruenbacher completely
rewrote the scripts, with the help of several other contributors (see
AUTHORS file in the distribution).

This man page was written by Martin Quinson, based on information found in
the pdf documentation, and in the help messages of each commands.
