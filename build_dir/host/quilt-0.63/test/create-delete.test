Check whether quilt generates patches properly so that GNU patch recognizes
file creates and deletions.

	$ mkdir patches

	$ echo delete > delete
	$ quilt new test.diff
	> Patch %{P}test.diff is now on top

	$ quilt add create
	> File create added to patch %{P}test.diff

	$ echo create > create
	$ quilt refresh
	> Refreshed patch %{P}test.diff

	$ quilt add delete
	> File delete added to patch %{P}test.diff

	$ rm -f delete
	$ quilt refresh
	> Refreshed patch %{P}test.diff
	$ quilt header -r
	< ---
	<  create |    1 +
	<  delete |    1 -
	<  2 files changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
	<
	> Replaced header of patch %{P}test.diff

	$ quilt patches -v create
	> = %{P}test.diff
	$ quilt patches delete
	> %{P}test.diff

	$ quilt pop -q
	> Removing patch %{P}test.diff
	> No patches applied

	$ quilt patches create
	> %{P}test.diff
	$ quilt patches -v delete
	>   %{P}test.diff
	$ quilt patches -- /dev/null dev/null null ---

	$ echo create > create
	$ rm -f delete
	$ patch -p1 --dry-run < patches/test.diff
	>~ The next patch would create the file `?create'?,
