General:

	- Abstract backup operations to/from the .pc/ directory, so that
	  optionally something like rcs can be used instead of
	  scripts/backup-files?

	- Add something similar to cvs diff, which scans all files for
	  changes that have not been folded back into their patches,
	  similar to:
	  `for p in $(quilt series); do quilt diff -z $p; done'?

	- Allow to add a directory? Then we could detect also new files
	  in the directory, without having to add them individually.

	- Support different diff/patch options for different patches.
	  (By specifying them in the series file?)

	- Add command that generates a summary (patch names + descriptions).

	- Add more long-form options, and add some nagative options so that
	  defaults from .quiltrc can easily be overruled.

	- series.conf: Allow to specify options like -R, -u, -Unum, -c,
	  -Cnum per patch.

	- Whenever the contents of the QUILT_PATCHES directory change,
	  optionally call a trigger so that another tool can keep track of
	  the patches directory history (e.g., CVS, RCS). Also call the
	  trigger when the series file changes?

	- Check if we can somehow support -p0 style patches that are
	  applied in subdirectories (patch -d option): There are problems
	  with relative $QUILT_PATCHES, and likely with several commands.

	- wrapper scripts: check with [ -ef ] if the wrapper is the same
	  as the default binary found to avoid wrappers like awk -> gawk.

	- Add some more colors.

	- Add the same kind of (optional) pager handling that git has.

Documentation:

	- How to import a complete directory before doing wild changes?

	- Describe how to work with hard-linked trees

	- /etc/quilt.quiltrc and ~/.quiltrc

	- diff/refresh: C -c -N -n options

	- Subdirectory support

quilt new:

	- Prevent spaces in patch names.

quilt push:

	- Add option to print the reject to stdout

	- If push fails, check if patch can be reversed.

	- Add -l option to ignore whitespace changes.

	- Check if there are any .orig or .rej files and barf if so.

quilt pop:

	- The timestamp comparison logic is broken; need to track
	  last-known timestamps per file.

quilt diff:

	- Error message when a file is specified that isn't in the
	  patch(es).

	- When a directory is specified, diff all files below it.

quilt refresh:

	- Add an -m option similar to `cvs commit -m "..."' to simplify
	  keeping a change log in the patch documentation?

	- Add option to log the updates of each patch (e.g., append the
	  output of ``quilt diff -zR'' to patch.log on each update).

	- Remove existing diffstat if --diffstat is not specified?

	- Improve whitespace stripping

quilt import:

	- Add option to replace the currently applied patch with a new
	  one, by backing out the topmost patch first.

quilt setup:

	- Also recognize other uses of tar and patch (with options in the
	  command line), etc.

quit edit:

	- Check for actual changes, and remove files again that haven't been
	  changed.

quilt files:

	- Print filenames relative to the working directory.

quilt mail:

	- Improve recipient handling (quote special characters automatically;
	  encode 8-bit characters).

	- Character set handling is missing, too.

	- Too many passes of edmail make it a bit slow.
	- If someone adds a References header to the intro, the References
	  header added to patch messages for threading do not append to that
	  header. They probably should; not sure if duplicate References
	  headers are valid.

quilt fold:

	- Add an -R option for reverse-applying a patch.
