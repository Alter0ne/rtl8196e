# The annotated listing is generated as follows: A file of annotations
# is created based on a file that contains the same number of lines as
# the source file, but all lines are empty.
#
# Then, for each patch that modifies the source file, an ed-style diff
# (which has no context, and removes lines that are removed without
# caring for the line's contents) is generated. In that diff, all line
# additions are replaced with the identifier of the patch (1, 2, ...).
# These patches are then applied to the empty file.
#
# Finally, the annotations listing is merged with the source file line
# by line.
