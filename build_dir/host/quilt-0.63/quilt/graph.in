Generate a dot(1) directed graph showing the dependencies between
applied patches. A patch depends on another patch if both touch the same
file or, with the --lines option, if their modifications overlap. Unless
otherwise specified, the graph includes all patches that the topmost
patch depends on.
When a patch name is specified, instead of the topmost patch, create a
graph for the specified patch. The graph will include all other patches
that this patch depends on, as well as all patches that depend on this
patch.

--all	Generate a graph including all applied patches and their
	dependencies. (Unapplied patches are not included.)

--reduce
	Eliminate transitive edges from the graph.

--lines[=num]
	Compute dependencies by looking at the lines the patches modify.
	Unless a different num is specified, two lines of context are
	included.

--edge-labels=files
	Label graph edges with the file names that the adjacent patches
	modify.

-T ps	Directly produce a PostScript output file.
