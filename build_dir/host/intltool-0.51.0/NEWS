intltool 0.50.2
===============

intltool 0.50.2 is another minor release improving backwards compatibility.
Only one bug is fixed in this release:

 * Use --no-translations only if intltool >= 0.50 is available (#903340).
   Patch contributed by Hib Eris (https://launchpad.net/~hiberis).

intltool 0.50.1
===============

intltool 0.50.1 is a minor release with the following improvements:

 * Support AM_SILENT_RULES (#402516).
   Patch contributed by Hib Eris (https://launchpad.net/~hiberis).

 * Improve support for extracting messages from GSettings files (#922685).
   Patch contributed by Ryan Lortie (https://launchpad.net/~desrt).

 * Support attribute tag extraction for Glade/GtkBuilder files (#923841).
   Patch contributed by Ryan Lortie (https://launchpad.net/~desrt).

 * Start including a ChangeLog in tarballs and provide a NEWS file (#924386).
   This introduces a soft dependency on "bzr": it's only required for
   maintainers who wish to regenerate a ChangeLog file from the bzr checkout.

 * Fix quoting of XGETTEXT variable when setting MSGMERGE and GENPOT
   in Makefile (#900738).
   Patch contributed by Matthias Klose (https://launchpad.net/~doko).


intltool 0.50.0
===============

intltool 0.50.0 is a major bug fix release.

Among the fixes, the following stand out:

 * Bug #580526
   Finally, support for gsettings gschema.xml files is merged in, which
   should enable maintainers to get a slightly simpler build setup
   (i.e. no need to use NOMERGE rule anymore, and you can have intltool
   directly extract translations from .gschema.xml files).

 * Bug #790574:
   Let xgettext extract Scheme strings out, and add support for
   `intltool-update -m` to find files with marked strings.

 * Bug #806006:
   Improve handling of quotes in `intltool-update -m` so you get less
   (no?) warnings about mismatched quotes, and Python processing doesn't
   get messed up with docstrings and similar.

 * Bug #520986:
   One for the translatorsâ€”messages are extracted in the order they appear
   in original files now, thus allowing translators to infer more of the
   context from the ordering.
