The following options are implemented but should not be a part of gs.
======================================================================

Option         Removed for reason
---------------------------------
relief         1) Backend should do decoration. 
               1) If we should have decoration it should be 
                  less tk dependent. Ex: {3d, on/off}
iconbitmask    Makes us even more X11 depndent.
bw             1) Borders are decoration.
               2) Borders introduce more color programming option unless a
                  color model exists. If we have this option,bc (border color),
                  selectbw and highlightbw, are soon coming.
padx/y         Nitty-gritty programming. Simple padding can be achieved
               with space. We can set width of a button and use align.
wraplength     Wrapping is ok for the editor but overkill for buttons.
               tk has support for it but how about other backends?
xselection     X11 dependent.
scale          Simple canvas objects such as oval and rectangle are simple
               to scale manually. We should thing more before intruducing it
               on bitmaps and text objects.
capstyle +     (Look of a line's endpoints.)
joinstyle      (How joined line segments should look.)
               These options should be one {pentype, circle/rectangle}
               (simplified and less tk inspired).
menu           (For menuitem.)
               This is taker care of implicitely by gs parent-child relation.
invoke         (For menuitem.)
               Only useful for explicit keyboard traversing of menues and
               that should not be controlled by the programmer.
selectbg       The color of the indicator can only be set at menu level.
