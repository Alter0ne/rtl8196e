=head1 NAME

Automake::Rule - support for rules definitions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Automake::Rule;
  use Automake::RuleDef;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides support for Makefile rule definitions.

An C<Automake::Rule> is a rule name associated to possibly
many conditional definitions.  These definitions are instances
of C<Automake::RuleDef>.

Therefore obtaining the value of a rule under a given
condition involves two lookups.  One to look up the rule,
and one to look up the conditional definition:

  my $rule = rule $name;
  if ($rule)
    {
      my $def = $rule->def ($cond);
      if ($def)
	{
	  return $def->location;
	}
      ...
    }
  ...

when it is known that the rule and the definition
being looked up exist, the above can be simplified to

  return rule ($name)->def ($cond)->location; # do not write this.

but is better written

  return rrule ($name)->rdef ($cond)->location;

or even

  return rruledef ($name, $cond)->location;

The I<r> variants of the C<rule>, C<def>, and C<ruledef> methods add
an extra test to ensure that the lookup succeeded, and will diagnose
failures as internal errors (with a message which is much more
informative than Perl's warning about calling a method on a
non-object).

# Same as $suffix_rules (declared below), but records only the
# default rules supplied by the languages Automake supports.
use vars '$_suffix_rules_default';

=item C<%dependencies>

Holds the dependencies of targets which dependencies are factored.
Typically, C<.PHONY> will appear in plenty of F<*.am> files, but must
be output once.  Arguably all pure dependencies could be subject to
this factoring, but it is not unpleasant to have paragraphs in
Makefile: keeping related stuff altogether.

=cut

use vars '%dependencies';

=item <%actions>

Holds the factored actions.  Tied to C<%dependencies>, i.e., filled
only when keys exists in C<%dependencies>.

=cut

use vars '%actions';

=item <$suffix_rules>

This maps the source extension for all suffix rules seen to
a C<hash> whose keys are the possible output extensions.

Note that this is transitively closed by construction:
if we have
      exists $suffix_rules{$ext1}{$ext2}
   && exists $suffix_rules{$ext2}{$ext3}
then we also have
      exists $suffix_rules{$ext1}{$ext3}

So it's easy to check whether C<.foo> can be transformed to
C<.$(OBJEXT)> by checking whether
C<$suffix_rules{'.foo'}{'.$(OBJEXT)'}> exists.  This will work even if
transforming C<.foo> to C<.$(OBJEXT)> involves a chain of several
suffix rules.

The value of C<$suffix_rules{$ext1}{$ext2}> is a pair
C<[ $next_sfx, $dist ]> where C<$next_sfx> is target suffix
for the next rule to use to reach C<$ext2>, and C<$dist> the
distance to C<$ext2'>.

The content of this variable should be updated via the
C<register_suffix_rule> function.

=cut

use vars '$suffix_rules';

=item C<$KNOWN_EXTENSIONS_PATTERN>

Pattern that matches all know input extensions (i.e. extensions used
by the languages supported by Automake).  Using this pattern (instead
of `\..*$') to match extensions allows Automake to support dot-less
extensions.

New extensions should be registered with C<accept_extensions>.
