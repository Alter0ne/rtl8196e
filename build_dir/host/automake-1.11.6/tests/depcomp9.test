# makedepend should work in VPATH mode.

# Here's the bug: makedepend will prefix VPATH to the object file name,
# thus the second make will invoke depcomp with object='../../src/foo.o',
# causing errors such as:
# touch: cannot touch `../../src/.deps/foo.TPo': No such file or directory
# makedepend: error:  cannot open "../../src/.deps/foo.TPo"
# ../../depcomp: line 560: ../../src/.deps/foo.TPo: No such file or directory

# We include subfoo only to be sure that we don't remove too much
# from the object file name.
