# "make dist" fails for AC_OUTPUT(README.foo:templ/README.foo.in).
#
# == Report ==
# When my AC_OUTPUT macro in configure.in contains something
# like the following (among the Makefiles)
#       README.foo:templ/README.foo.in
# the generated dist target in the Makefile.in fails,
# because DIST_COMMON will contain templ/README.foo.in
# and the dist target will try to copy templ/README.foo.in
# to the distribution directory before it creates a templ
# subdirectory in the distribution directory.
