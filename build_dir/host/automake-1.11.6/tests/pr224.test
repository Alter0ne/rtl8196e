# Test for PR automake/224: $(top_srcdir) w.r.t. dependencies.
#
# == Description ==
# Dependency tracking data should be stored in in the relative path
# of the source file, as opposed the object file.
# I.e., for `foo.c' in `$(top_srcdir)/bar', being built in
# `$(top_srcdir)/build', the location of the `.deps' directory
# should be `$(top_builddir)/bar/.deps'.
