# For each automake test case that checks features of the TESTS automake
# interface, generate a sibling test that does likewise, but with the
# option `parallel-tests' enabled.  Individual tests can prevent the
# creation of such a sibling by explicitly setting the `$parallel_tests'
# variable to either "yes" or "no".  The rationale for this is that if
# the variable is set to "yes", the test already uses the `parallel-tests'
# option, so that a sibling would be just a duplicate; while if the
# variable is set to "no", the test doesn't support, or is not meant to
# run with, the `parallel-tests' option, and forcing it to do so in the
# sibling would likely cause a spurious failure.
