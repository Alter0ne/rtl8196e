= This file

* This file attempts to describe the rules to use when hacking
  automake.

================================================================
= Administrivia

* The correct response to most actual bugs is to write a new test case
  which demonstrates the bug.  Then fix the bug, re-run the test suite,
  and check everything in.

* If you incorporate a change from somebody on the net:
  First, if it is a large change, you must make sure they have signed the
  appropriate paperwork.
  Second, be sure to add their name and email address to THANKS

* If a change fixes a test, mention the test in the commit message.
  If a change fixes a bug registered in the Automake debbugs tracker,
  mention the bug number in the commit message.

* If somebody reports a new bug, mention his name in the commit message
  and in the test case you write.  Put him into THANKS.

* When documenting a non-trivial idiom or example in the manual, be
  sure to add a test case for it, and to reference such test case from
  a proper Texinfo comment.

* Some files in the automake package are not owned by automake; these
  files are listed in the $(FETCHFILES) variable in Makefile.am.  They
  should never be edited here.  Almost all of them can be updated from
  respective upstreams with "make fetch" (this should be done especially
  before releases).  The only exception is the 'lib/COPYING' (from FSF),
  which should be updated by hand whenever the GPL gets updated (which
  shouldn't happen that often anyway :-)

* Changes other than bug fixes must be mentioned in NEWS.  Important
  bug fixes should be mentioned in NEWS, too.

================================================================
= Naming

* We've adopted the convention that internal AC_SUBSTs should be
  named with a leading `am__', and internally generated targets
  should be named with a leading `am--'.  This convention, although
  in place from at least February 2001, isn't yet universally used.
  But all new code should use it.

  We used to use `_am_' as the prefix for an internal AC_SUBST.
  However, it turns out that NEWS-OS 4.2R complains if a Makefile
  variable begins with `_'.  Yay for them.  I changed the target
  naming convention just to be safe.

================================================================
= Editing `.am' files

* Always use $(...) and not ${...}

* Use `:', not `true'.  Use `exit 1', not `false'.

* Use `##' comments liberally.  Comment anything even remotely
  unusual.

* Never use basename or dirname.  Instead use sed.

* Do not use `cd' within back-quotes, use `$(am__cd)' instead.
  Otherwise the directory name may be printed, depending on CDPATH.
  More generally, do not ever use plain `cd' together with a relative
  directory that does not start with a dot, or you might end up in one
  computed with CDPATH.

* For install and uninstall rules, if a loop is required, it should be
  silent.  Then the body of the loop itself should print each
  "important" command it runs.  The printed commands should be preceded
  by a single space.

* Ensure install rules do not create any installation directory where
  nothing is to be actually installed.  See automake bug#11030.

================================================================
= Editing automake.in and aclocal.in

* Indent using GNU style.  For historical reasons, the perl code
  contains portions indented using Larry Wall's style (perl-mode's
  default), and other portions using the GNU style (cperl-mode's
  default).  Write new code using GNU style.

* Don't use & for function calls, unless required.
  The use of & prevents prototypes from being checked.
  Just as above, don't change massively all the code to strip the
  &, just convert the old code as you work on it, and write new
  code without.

================================================================
= Working with git

* To regenerate dependent files created by aclocal and automake,
  use the `bootstrap' script.  It uses the code from the source
  tree, so the resulting files (aclocal.m4 and Makefile.in) should
  be the same as you would get if you install this version of
  automake and use it to generate those files.  Be sure to have the
  latest stable version of Autoconf installed.  If such version is
  not installed as "autoconf", pass it explicitly (along with the
  accompanying "autom4te") when calling `bootstrap' and `configure'.
  For example:
    $ AUTOCONF=autoconf2.68 AUTOM4TE=autom4te2.68 ./bootstrap
    $ ./configure AUTOCONF=autoconf2.68 AUTOM4TE=autom4te2.68

* Dependent files aclocal.m4, configure and Makefile.in in all
  directories should be up to date in the git repository, so that
  the changes in them can be easily noticed and analyzed.

* The git tree currently carries a number of branches: master for the
  current development, and release branches named branch-X.Y.  The maint
  branch serves as common ground for both master and the active release
  branches.  Changes intended for both should be applied to maint, which
  should then be merged to release branches and master, of course after
  suitable testing.  It is advisable to merge only after a set of related
  commits have been applied.

* Example work flow for patches to maint:

  # 1. Checkout the "maint" branch:
  git checkout maint

  # 2. Apply the patch(es) with "git am" (or create them with $EDITOR):
  git am -3 0*.patch
  # 2a. Run required tests, if any ...

  # 3. Merge maint into branch-1.11:
  git checkout branch-1.11
  git merge maint
  # 3a. Run required tests, if any ...

  # 4. Redo steps 3 and 3a for master:
  git checkout master
  git merge maint
  # testing ...

  # 5. Push the maint and master branches:
  git push --dry-run origin maint branch-1.11 master
  # if all seems ok, then actually push:
  git push origin maint branch-1.11 master

* When fixing a bug (especially a long-standing one), it may be useful
  to commit the fix to a new temporary branch based off the commit that
  introduced the bug.  Then this "bugfix branch" can be merged into all
  the active branches descending from the buggy commit.  This offers a
  simple way to fix the bug consistently and effectively.

* When referring to older commits, use 'git describe' output as pointer.

* There may be a number of longer-lived feature branches for new developments.
  They should be based off of a common ancestor of all active branches to
  which the feature should or might be merged later.  The next branch may
  serve as common ground for feature merging and testing, should they not
  be ready for master yet.

* For merges from branches other than maint, prefer 'git merge --log' over
  plain 'git merge', so that a later 'git log' gives an indication of which
  actual patches were merged even when they don't appear early in the list.

* master and release branches should not be rewound, i.e., should always
  fast-forward, except maybe for privacy issues.  The maint branch should not
  be rewound except maybe after retiring a release branch or a new stable
  release.  For next, and for feature branches, the announcement for the
  branch should document rewinding policy.

================================================================
= Test suite

* Use "make check" and "make maintainer-check" liberally.

* Make sure each test file is executable.

* Use `keep_testdirs=yes' to keep test directories for successful
  tests also.

* Use perl coverage information to ensure your new code is thoroughly
  tested by your new tests.

* See file `tests/README' for more information.

================================================================
= Release procedure

* The steps outlined here are meant to be followed for alpha and stable
  releases as well.  Where differences are expected, they will be
  explicitly described.

* Fetch new versions of the files that are maintained by the FSF.
  Commit.  Unfortunately you need an FSF account to do this.
  (You can also use `make fetch', but that is still woefully incomplete.)

* Update NEWS.

* Update the version number in configure.ac.
  (The idea is that every other alpha number will be a net release.
  The repository will always have its own "odd" number so we can easily
  distinguish net and repo versions.)

* Run this:
  ./bootstrap && ./configure && make && make check && make distcheck

* Run `make release-stats' if release statistics in doc/automake.texi
  have not been updated yet.

* Run `make git-release'.
  This will run "make dist" to create the tarballs, commit the last
  changes to NEWS, configure.ac and m4/amversion.m4, tag the repository,
  sign the tarballs, and upload them.
  Use `make GNUPLOADFLAGS="--user key" git-release' to sign with
  a non-default key.

* Update version number in configure.ac to next alpha number.
  Re-run ./bootstrap and commit.

* Don't forget to `git push' your changes so they appear in the public
  git tree.

* For stable releases, update the manuals at www.gnu.org:
  - Generate manuals:
    cd doc
    wget "http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/~checkout~/texinfo/texinfo/util/gendocs.sh"
    wget "http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/~checkout~/texinfo/texinfo/util/gendocs_template"
    sh ./gendocs.sh --email bug-automake@gnu.org automake "GNU Automake"
  - copy manuals recursively to web cvs,
  - commit.
  - Check for link errors, fix them, recheck until convergence:
    <http://validator.w3.org/checklink>

* Send the announcement at least to <autotools-announce@gnu.org> and
  <automake@gnu.org>.  If the release is a stable one, the announcement
  must also go to <info-gnu@gnu.org>; if it is an alpha or beta release,
  announcement should be sent also to <platform-testers@gnu.org>, to
  maximize the possibility of early testing on exotic or proprietary
  systems.  Finally, copy the announcement into the NEWS feed at
  <https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/automake>.
