This is GNU patch, which applies diff files to original files.

This version of patch has many changes made by the Free Software Foundation.
They add support for:
 * handling arbitrary binary data and large files
 * the unified context diff format that GNU diff can produce
 * merging into files instead of creating reject files
 * making GNU Emacs-style backup files
 * improved interaction with RCS and SCCS
 * the GNU conventions for option parsing and configuring and compilation.
 * better POSIX compliance
They also fix some bugs.

If you obtained this file as part of a "git clone", then see the
README-hacking file.  If this file came to you as part of a tar archive,
then see the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.
A more detailed descripiton of all changes can be found in the file ChangeLog
in tar archives, and with "git log" which shows the version control history.

Tutorial-style documentation for patch is included in the GNU
Diffutils package; get GNU Diffutils 2.8 or later for up-to-date
documentation for patch.

Use `configure --disable-largefile' to disable large file support;
this is reportedly necessary on Red Hat GNU/Linux 6.0 to avoid a C library bug.
For MS-DOS using DJGPP tools, see the file pc/djgpp/README.
For other systems, copy config.hin to config.h and change
#undef statements in it to #define as appropriate for your system,
and copy Makefile.in to Makefile and set the variables that are
enclosed in @ signs as appropriate for your system.

Please send bug reports for this version of patch to

The Free Software Foundation is distributing this version of patch
independently because as of this writing, Larry Wall has not released a
new version of patch since mid-1988.  We have heard that he has been
too busy working on other things, like Perl.  He has graciously agreed
to let GNU `patch' be distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License.
