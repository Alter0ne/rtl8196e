Description: The Google Authenticator project includes implementations of one-time
passcode generators for several mobile platforms, as well as a pluggable
authentication module (PAM). One-time passcodes are generated using open
standards developed by the Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH)
(which is unrelated to OAuth).

These implementations support the HMAC-Based One-time Password (HOTP)
algorithm specified in RFC 4226 and the Time-based One-time Password
(TOTP) algorithm specified in RFC 6238.
