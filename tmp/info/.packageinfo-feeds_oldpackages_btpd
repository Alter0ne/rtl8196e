Description: 	BTPD is a bittorrent client consisting of a daemon and client commands,
	which can be used to read and/or manipulate the daemon state.
	The daemon is capable of running several torrents simultaneously and
	only uses one tcp port.
	It's fairly low on resource usage and should be perfect for file
	distribution sites.
	Efficient downloads and ease of use makes this client a good choice for
	the casual user as well.
