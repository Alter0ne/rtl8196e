Description:   This program emulates an AirPort Express for the purpose of streaming
  music from iTunes and compatible iPods. It implements a server for the
  Apple RAOP protocol.
  ShairPort does not support AirPlay v2 (video and photo streaming).

  It supports multiple simultaneous streams, if your audio output chain
  (as detected by libao) does so.
