Description:   Liboil is a library of simple functions that are optimized for various CPUs.
  These functions are generally loops implementing simple algorithms, such as
  converting an array of N integers to floating-point numbers or multiplying
  and summing an array of N numbers. Such functions are candidates for significant
  optimization using various techniques, especially by using extended instructions
  provided by modern CPUs (Altivec, MMX, SSE, etc.).
