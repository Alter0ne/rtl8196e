Description:   This daemon is in charge of multiplexing connections over USB to an iPhone or
  iPod touch. To users, it means you can sync your music, contacts, photos, etc.
  over USB. To developers, it means you can connect to any listening localhost
  socket on the device. usbmuxd is not used for tethering data transfer, which
  uses a dedicated USB interface as a virtual network device.
