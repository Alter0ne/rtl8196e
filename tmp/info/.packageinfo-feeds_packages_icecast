Description: 	Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg
	Vorbis and MP3 audio streams. It can be used to create an Internet
	radio station or a privately running jukebox and many things in
	between. It is very versatile in that new formats can be added
	relatively easily and supports open standards for commuincation and
	interaction.
