Description:   GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a library designed to make access to GnuPG easier for
  applications. It provides a High-Level Crypto API for encryption, decryption, signing,
  signature verification and key management. Currently it uses GnuPG as its backend but
  the API isn't restricted to this engine; in fact we have already developed a backend
  for CMS (S/MIME).
