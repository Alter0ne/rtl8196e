Maintainer: Daniel Dickinson <cshored@thecshore.com>
Source: passlib-1.7.1.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Feed: oldpackages
Description: Passlib is a password hashing library for Python 2 & 3, which provides
cross-platform implementations of over 30 password hashing algorithms,
as well as a framework for managing existing password hashes. It’s
designed to be useful for a wide range of tasks, from verifying a hash
found in /etc/shadow, to providing full-strength password hashing for
multi-user applications.
