Maintainer:

Type: ipkg
Feed: oldpackages
Description: 	ssldump is an SSLv3/TLS network protocol analyzer. It identifies TCP connections on the chosen network interface
	and attempts to interpret them as SSLv3/TLS traffic. When it identifies SSLv3/TLS traffic, it decodes the records
	and displays them in a textual form to stdout. If provided with the appropriate keying material, it will also decrypt
	the connections and display the application data traffic.
