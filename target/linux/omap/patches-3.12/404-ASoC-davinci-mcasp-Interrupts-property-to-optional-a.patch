Subject: [PATCH 215/752] ASoC: davinci-mcasp: Interrupts property to optional
 and add interrupt-names

Makes interrupts property optional as the interrupts are not currently
used by the driver and adds interrupt-names property to name listed
interrupts. Currently know interrupt names are "tx" and "rx".
