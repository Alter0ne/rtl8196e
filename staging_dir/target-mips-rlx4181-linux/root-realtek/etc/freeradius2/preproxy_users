#  This file is similar to the "users" file.  The check items
#  are compared against the request, but the "reply" items are
#  used to update the proxied packet, not the reply to the NAS.
#
#  You can use this file to re-write requests which are about to
#  be sent to a home server.
#

#
#  Requests destinated to realm "extisp" are sent to a RADIUS
#  home server hosted by an other company which doesn't know about
#  the IP addresses of our NASes. Therefore we replace the value of
#  the NAS-IP-Address attribute by a unique value we communicated
#  to them.
#
#DEFAULT Realm == "extisp"
#	NAS-IP-Address := 10.1.2.3

#
#  For all proxied packets, set the User-Name in the proxied packet
#  to the Stripped-User-Name, if it exists.  If not, set it to the
#  User-Name from the original request.
#
#DEFAULT
#	User-Name := `%{Stripped-User-Name:-%{User-Name}}`
