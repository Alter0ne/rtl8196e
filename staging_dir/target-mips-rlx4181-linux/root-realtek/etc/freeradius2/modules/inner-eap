#  Sample configuration for an EAP module that occurs *inside*
#  of a tunneled method.  It is used to limit the EAP types that
#  can occur inside of the inner tunnel.
#
#  See also raddb/sites-available/inner-tunnel
#
#  To use this module, edit raddb/sites-available/inner-tunnel, and
#  replace the references to "eap" with "inner-eap".
#
#  See raddb/eap.conf for full documentation on the meaning of the
#  configuration entries here.

	timer_expire     = 60

	#  This should be the same as the outer eap "max sessions"
	max_sessions = 2048

	## EAP-TLS
	#
	#  You SHOULD use different certificates than are used
	#  for the outer EAP configuration!
	#
	#  Support for PEAP/TLS and RFC 5176 TLS/TLS is experimental.

		#  If Private key & Certificate are located in
		#  the same file, then private_key_file &
		#  certificate_file must contain the same file
		#  name.
		#
		#  If CA_file (below) is not used, then the
		#  certificate_file below MUST include not
		#  only the server certificate, but ALSO all
		#  of the CA certificates used to sign the
		#  server certificate.

		#  Trusted Root CA list
		#
		#  ALL of the CA's in this list will be trusted
		#  to issue client certificates for authentication.
		#
		#  In general, you should use self-signed
		#  certificates for 802.1x (EAP) authentication.
		#  In that case, this CA file should contain
		#  *one* CA certificate.
		#
		#  This parameter is used only for EAP-TLS,
		#  when you issue client certificates.  If you do
		#  not use client certificates, and you do not want
		#  to permit EAP-TLS authentication, then delete
		#  this configuration item.

		#
		#  This can never exceed the size of a RADIUS
		#  packet (4096 bytes), and is preferably half
		#  that, to accomodate other attributes in
		#  RADIUS packet.  On most APs the MAX packet
		#  length is configured between 1500 - 1600
		#  In these cases, fragment size should be
		#  1024 or less.

		#
		#  1) Copy CA certificates and CRLs to same directory.
