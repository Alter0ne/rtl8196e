#
# This is an example configuration file for ser2net.  It has the following
# format:
#  <TCP port>:<state>:<timeout>:<device>:<options>
#     TCP port
#            Name   or  number of the TCP/IP port to accept con-
#            nections from for this device.  A port number may
#            be of the form [host,]port, such as 127.0.0.1,2000
#            or localhost,2000.  If this is specified, it will
#            only bind to the IP address specified. Otherwise
#            it will bind to all the ports on the machine.
#
#     state  Either raw or rawlp or telnet or off.  off disables
#            the  port  from  accepting  connections.  It can be
#            turned on later from the control port.  raw enables
#            the port and  transfers  all data as-is between the
#            port  and  the long.  rawlp  enables  the port  and
#            transfers  all input data to device, device is open
#            without  any  termios  setting.  It  allow  to  use
#            /dev/lpX  devices  and  printers connected to them.
#            telnet enables the port and runs the telnet  proto-
#            col  on the port to set up telnet parameters.  This
#            is most useful for using telnet.
#
#     timeout
#            The time (in seconds) before the port will be  dis-
#            connected  if  there  is no activity on it.  A zero
#            value disables this function.
#
#     device The  name  of  the  device   to  connect  to.  This
#            must be in the form of /dev/<device>.
#
#     options
#            Sets  operational  parameters  for the serial port.
#            Options 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400,
#            57600, 115200 set the various baud rates.  EVEN,
#            ODD, NONE set the parity.  1STOPBIT, 2STOPBITS set
#            the number of stop bits.  7DATABITS, 8DATABITS set
#            the number of data bits.  [-]XONXOFF turns on (-
#            off) XON/XOFF support.  [-]RTSCTS turns on (- off)
#            hardware flow control, [-]LOCAL turns off (- on)
#            monitoring of the modem lines, and
#            [-]HANGUP_WHEN_DONE turns on (- off) lowering the
#            modem control lines when the connection is done. 
#            NOBREAK disables automatic setting of the break
#            setting of the serial port.
#            The "remctl" option allow remote control (ala RFC
#            2217) of serial-port configuration.
#            A banner name, signature, open string, and/or close
#            string may also be specified.
#            The tw, tr, and tb options take a tracefile name (
#            specified in TRACEFILE that will take all traced data.
#            tw is data written to the device, tr is data read from
#            the device, and tb is both.
#
# or...

#  BANNER:<banner name>:banner
#    This will create a banner, if the banner name is given in the
#    options of a line, that banner will be printed.  This takes the
#    standard "C" \x characters (\r is carriage return, \n is newline,
#    etc.).  It also accepts \d, which prints the device name, \p,
#    which prints the TCP port number, and \s which prints the serial
#    parameters (eg 9600 N81), and a large number of date related
#    items.  See the man page for details..  Banners can span lines if
#    the last character on a line is '\'.  Note that you *must* use
#    \r\n to start a new line.
#
#  SIGNATURE:<signature name>:signature
#    This will create a RFC 2217 signature, that will be sent on clients
#    request.
#
#  TRACEFILE:<name>:filename
#    This specifies a filename to trace output into, as tw=/tmp/trace1.
#    This takes the same escape sequences as banners.
#
#  OPENSTR:<name>:str
#    This specifies a string to be transmitted to the device when the
#    port is opened.  This takes the same escape sequences as banners.
#
#  CLOSESTR:<name>:str
#    This specifies a string to be transmitted to the device when the
#    port is close.  This takes the same escape sequences as banners.
#
#  CONTROLPORT:<port spec>
#    Allow the control port to be specified in the config file.
#
# Note that the same device can be listed multiple times under different
# ports, this allows the same serial port to have both telnet and raw
# protocols.
