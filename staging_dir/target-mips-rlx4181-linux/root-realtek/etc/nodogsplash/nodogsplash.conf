# Nodogsplash Configuration File
#

# Parameter: GatewayInterface
# Default: NONE
#
# GatewayInterface is not autodetected, has no default, and must be set here.
# Set GatewayInterface to the interface on your router
# that is to be managed by Nodogsplash.
# Typically br0 for the wired and wireless lan on OpenWrt White Russian.
# May be br-lan on OpenWrt Kamikaze.

# FirewallRuleSet: authenticated-users
#
# Control access for users after authentication.
# These rules are inserted at the beginning of the
# FORWARD chain of the router's filter table, and
# apply to packets that have come in to the router
# over the GatewayInterface from MAC addresses that
# have authenticated with Nodogsplash, and that are
# destined to be routed through the router.  The rules are
# considered in order, and the first rule that matches
# a packet applies to it.
# If there are any rules in this ruleset, an authenticated
# packet that does not match any rule is rejected.
# N.B.: This ruleset is completely independent of
# the preauthenticated-users ruleset.
#

 # You may want to open access to a machine on a local
 # subnet that is otherwise blocked (for example, to
 # serve a redirect page; see RedirectURL).  If so,
 # allow that explicitly here, e.g:
 #  FirewallRule allow tcp port 80 to 192.168.254.254

 # Your router may have several interfaces, and you
 # probably want to keep them private from the GatewayInterface.
 # If so, you should block the entire subnets on those interfaces, e.g.:
    FirewallRule block to 192.168.0.0/16
    FirewallRule block to 10.0.0.0/8

 # Typical ports you will probably want to open up include
 # 53 udp and tcp for DNS,
 # 80 for http,
 # 443 for https,
 # 22 for ssh:
    FirewallRule allow tcp port 53

# These rules are inserted in the PREROUTING chain
# of the router's nat table, and in the
# FORWARD chain of the router's filter table.
# These rules apply to packets that have come in to the 
# router over the GatewayInterface from MAC addresses that
# are not on the BlockedMACList or TrustedMACList,
# are *not* authenticated with Nodogsplash.  The rules are

# EmptyRuleSetPolicy directives
# The FirewallRuleSets that NoDogSplash permits are:
#
# authenticated-users
# preauthenticated-users
# users-to-router
# trusted-users
# trusted-users-to-router
#
# For each of these, an EmptyRuleSetPolicy can be specified.
# An EmptyRuleSet policy applies to a FirewallRuleSet if the
# FirewallRuleSet is missing from this configuration file,
# or if it exists but contains no FirewallRules.
#
# The possible values of an EmptyRuleSetPolicy are:
# allow  -- packets are accepted
# block  -- packets are rejected
# passthrough -- packets are passed through to pre-existing firewall rules
#
# Default EmptyRuleSetPolicies are set as follows:
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy authenticated-users passthrough
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy preauthenticated-users block
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy users-to-router block
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy trusted-users allow
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy trusted-users-to-router allow


# Parameter: GatewayName
# Default: NoDogSplash
#
# Set  GatewayName to the name of your gateway.  This value

# If none is supplied, the value "NoDogSplash" is used.
#
# GatewayName NoDogSplash

# Parameter: GatewayAddress
# Default: Discovered from GatewayInterface

# GatewayAddress 192.168.1.1

# Parameter: ExternalInterface
# Default: Autodetected from /proc/net/route
#
# This should be autodetected on a OpenWRT system, but if not:

# i.e. the one which provides the default route to the internet.
# Typically vlan1 for OpenWRT.
#
# ExternalInterface vlan1

# Default: no
#
# Set to yes (or true or 1), to immediately authenticate users

# or to RedirectURL if set).
#
# AuthenticateImmediately no

# Parameter: MACMechanism
# Default: block
#
# Either block or allow.
# If 'block', MAC addresses on BlockedMACList are blocked from
# authenticating, and all others are allowed.
# If 'allow', MAC addresses on AllowedMACList are allowed to
# authenticate, and all other (non-trusted) MAC's are blocked.
#
# MACMechanism block

# Parameter: BlockedMACList
# Default: none
#
# Comma-separated list of MAC addresses who will be completely blocked
# from the GatewayInterface.  Ignored if MACMechanism is allow.
# N.B.: weak security, since MAC addresses are easy to spoof.

#
# TrafficControl no

# Parameter: DownloadLimit
# Default: 0
#
# If TrafficControl is enabled, this sets the maximum download
# speed to the GatewayInterface, in kilobits per second.
# For example if you have an ADSL connection with 768 kbit
# download speed, and you want to allow about half of that
# bandwidth for the GatewayInterface, set this to 384.
# A value of 0 means no download limiting is done.
#
# DownloadLimit 384

# Parameter: UploadLimit
# Default: 0
#
# If TrafficControl is enabled, this sets the maximum upload
# speed from the GatewayInterface, in kilobits per second.
# For example if you have an ADSL connection with 128 kbit
# upload speed, and you want to allow about half of that
# bandwidth for the GatewayInterface, set this to 64.

# and passed to a command line call along with the clients MAC:
#
# $<BinVoucher> auth_voucher <mac> <voucher>
#
# BinVoucher must point to a program that will be called as described above.
# The call is expected to output the number of seconds the client
# is to be authenticated. Zero or negative seconds will cause the
# authentification request to be rejected.
# The output may contain a user specific download and upload limit in KBit/s:
# <seconds> <download> <upload>
#
# BinVoucher "/bin/myauth"

# Parameter: ForceVoucher
# Default: no
#
# Force the use of a voucher. Authentification is not possible without voucher.
#
# ForceVoucher no

# Parameter: EnablePreAuth
# Default: no
#
# Enable pre-authentication support.
# Pass the MAC of a client to a command line call before the splash page
# would be send:
#
# $<BinVoucher> auth_status <mac>
#
# The call is expected to output the number of seconds the client
# is to be authenticated. Zero or negative seconds will cause the
# splash page to be displayed.
# The output may contain a user specific download and upload limit in KBit/s:
# <seconds> <download> <upload>
#
# EnablePreAuth no
