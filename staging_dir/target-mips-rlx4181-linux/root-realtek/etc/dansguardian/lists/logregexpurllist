# Log regular expression URL list
#
# This acts as a list of URL regexes which, if matched, will have their category
# recorded but no specific filtering action taken.  It is only really useful
# in conjunction with log analysers, to perform meaningful categorisation and
# analysis upon non-blocked/exception requests, and so is disabled and empty
# by default.
#
# If you would like to enable this feature, uncomment "logregexpurllist" in your
# dansguardianf*.conf file(s), and place .Include<> statements here for the
# categories you would like to log.  Included list files must contain a
# "#listcategory" directive.
