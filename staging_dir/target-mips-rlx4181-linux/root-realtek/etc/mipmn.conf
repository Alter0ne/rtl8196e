# It contains six main parts (the following ordering must be preserved):
#    1. version indicator
#    2. (optional) attribute value pairs
#    3. Home Address, HomeNetmask  and default routers at home
#    4. number of home agents
#    5. configuration info for each home agent
#    6. Firewall traversal information 

# version number for the configuration file. This line is required
# and must be the first non-comment/non-blank line.

# Other (optional) attribute-value pairs. Note that the attribute names are
# case insensitive and the program uses appropriate default values for
# attributes not specified in this configuration file. The unit of time is
# seconds. Currently the following attributes are allowed:

# debuglevel       	0-3 (controls verbosity of debug messages, 0=severe
#                            problems, 1=unexpected behavior, 2=important 
#                            events, 3=complete trace including messages)
# periodicInterval  	n   (Controls the granularity of various internal
#                           internal timers, e.g. aging of local mobility

# agentSolicitThreshold	t1  (If a mobile node hasn't heard from an agent in

#                           the agent is indeed unreachable)
# agentExpireThreshold  t2  (If a mobile node hasn't heard from an agent in
#                           the last t2 (> t1) seconds, it considers that

#  IDfreshnessSLack	n  (When using timestamps for replay protection,

# Information about the mobile node's home network
# <Home Address of Mobile node>	<Netmask> <default routers>
# <default routers> is either a list of IP addresses in dotted decimal or
# the keyword "discover" (without quotes).
# NOTE: Currently, only an explicit list of routers is supported. To be
#       safe, we recommend that you specify only one default router
#       instead of a list. Different operating systems deal differently
#       with multiple default routing entries.

# uses SPI 257, NONCE-based replay protection and a 16 byte long key
# with each byte being 0x11 (i.e. hexadecimal 11). In addition, the mobile
# node can dynamically discover other home agents and for them it uses
# SPI 570, TIMESTAMP based replay protection, 16-byte key with each byte
# equal to 0x22 (i.e. decimal 34).
