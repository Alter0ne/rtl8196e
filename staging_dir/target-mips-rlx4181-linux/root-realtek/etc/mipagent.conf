# Sample configuration file for mobility agents. Lines starting with the hash
# character are treated as comments. Blank lines are ignored. 
# It contains six main parts (the following ordering must be preserved):
#    1. version indicator
#    2. (optional) attribute value pairs
#    3. number of mobility supporting interfaces
#    4. configuration info for each mobility supporting interface
#    5. number of mobile nodes to which HA services are offered.
#    6. configuration information for each such mobile node.
#
# Note that part 2 is optional and if item 5 is zero, item 6 need
# not be present.

# version number for the configuration file. This line is required
# and must be the first non-comment/non-blank line.

version	1

# Other (optional) attribute-value pairs. Note that the attribute names are
# case insensitive. Currently the following attributes are allowed:
#
#  debuglevel       0-3 (controls verbosity of debug messages, 0=severe
#                        problems, 1=unexpected behavior, 2=important events
#                        3=complete trace including messages)
#  IDfreshnessSLack  n  (When using timestamps for replay protection,
#	     	         this is the maximum skew tolerated in timestamp
#	                 comparisons).
#  regLifetime       n  (Lifetime advertised in the mobility extension)
#  advLifetime       n  (Lifetime advertised in the RFC1256 portion)
#  periodicInterval  n  (Controls the frequency of advertisements and
#                        the granularity of other internal timers, e.g.
#                        aging of various bindings etc). This interval
#                        must be less than 1/3 advLifeTime.
#  advertiseOnBcast  1  (If 1, advertisements are sent on 255.255.255.255
#                        rather than 224.0.0.1)
#
# GUIRecvActive         n (indicates whether the information module that
#                          sends data to GUIs is active or not;
#                          1 = active, 0 = inactive)
#
# GUIRecvPortNum        n (indicates on what port the GUIs should send
#                          signals to the mobile node software : should
#                          be any port above 2048 and currently not used,
#                          use socklist program to figure unused ports)
#
# The agent program initializes appropriate default values for these
# parameters in agent.c (near the start).

# number of mobility supporting interfaces
1

# one line for each interface containing:
#   interface name, addr, netmask, advertised services flag, and prefix flag
# The advertised services flag should be a hexadecimal number obtained
# by the logical ORing of some combination of the following.
#
#    ADV_IS_HOME_AGENT          0x20
#    ADV_IS_FOREIGN_AGENT       0x10
#    ADV_MIN_ENCAP              0x08
#    ADV_GRE_ENCAP              0x04
#    ADV_VJ_COMPRESSION         0x02
#
# It is invalid to set any service flag which is not currently implemented.
# The prefix flag is either 0 or 1 and controls whether prefix length
# extensions are included in agent advertisements (1 = include).
# In the following example, advertisements sent out on le0 offer
# both home agent and foreign agent services (0x20 | 0x10 = 0x30)
# and prefix length extensions are included.

# number of supported mobile nodes
2

# one line for each supported mobile node containing:

# The replay protection code determines the replay protection 
# algorithm used (0=NONE, 1=TIMESTAMPS, 2=NONCES). In the following
# example, SPI is 1, NONCES are used for replay protection and the
# key is 16 byte long with each byte being 0x11 (i.e. hexadecimal 11).
