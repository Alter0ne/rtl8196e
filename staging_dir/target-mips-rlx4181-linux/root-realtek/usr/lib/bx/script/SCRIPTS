There are several scripts which have been packaged in the scripts/ directory
for opers, fserve, and logging for BitchX.

Also included is the popular script Cypress by void.  Please remember if you
use/install this script that it must be installed from the top level of your
home directory or it will NOT work.

Enjoy and thanks from all of us!
