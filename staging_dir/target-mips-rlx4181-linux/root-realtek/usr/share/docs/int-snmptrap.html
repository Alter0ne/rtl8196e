<font color="red"><strong>Note:</strong></font> Nagios is not designed to be a replacement for a full-blown SNMP management application like HP OpenView or <a href="http://www.opennms.org/">OpenNMS</a>.  However, you can set things up so that SNMP traps received by a host on your network can generate alerts in Nagios.  Here's how...
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
This example explains how to easily generate alerts in Nagios for SNMP traps that are received by the <a href="http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net">UCD-SNMP</a> <i>snmptrapd</i> daemon.  These directions assume that the host which is receiving SNMP traps is not the same host on which Nagios is running.  If your monitoring box is the same box that is receiving SNMP traps you will need to make a few modifications to the examples I provide.  Also, I am assuming that you having installed the <a href="addons.html#nsca">nsca daemon</a> on your monitoring server and the nsca client (<i>send_nsca</i>) on the machine that is receiving SNMP traps.
</p>

<p>
For the purposes of this example, I will be describing how I setup Nagios to generate alerts from SNMP traps received by the ArcServe backup jobs running on my Novell servers.  I wanted to get notified when backups failed, so this worked very nicely for me.  You'll have to tweak the examples in order to make it suit your needs.
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>Additional Software</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
Translating SNMP traps into Nagios events can be a bit tedious.  If you'd like to make it easier, you might want to check out Alex Burger's SNMP Trap Translator project located at <a href="http://www.snmptt.org">http://www.snmptt.org</a> which, combined with Net-SNMP, provides a more enhanced trap handling system. The snmptt documentation includes integration details for Nagios.
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>Defining The Service</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
First off you're going to have to define a service in your <a href="configobject.html">object configuration file</a> for the SNMP traps (in this example, I am defining a service for ArcServe backup jobs).  Assuming that the host that the alerts are originating from is called <b>novellserver</b>, a sample service definition might look something like this:
</p>

<p>
<font color="red">
<pre>
define service{
	host_name                       novellserver
	service_description             ArcServe Backup
	is_volatile                     1
	active_checks_enabled		0
	passive_checks_enabled		1
	max_check_attempts              1
	contact_groups                  novell-backup-admins
	notification_interval           120
	notification_period             24x7
	notification_options            w,u,c,r
	check_command                   check_none
	}
</pre>
</font>
</p>

<p>
Important things to note are the fact that this service has the <i>volatile</i> option enabled.  We want this option enabled because we want a notification to be generated for every alert that comes in.  Also of note is the fact that active checks are disabled for the service, while passive checks are enabled.  This means that the service will never be actively checked - all alert information will have to be sent in passively by the <i>nsca client</i> on the SNMP management host (in my example, it will be called <b>firestorm</b>).
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>ArcServe and Novell SNMP Configuration</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
In order to get ArcServe (and my Novell server) to send SNMP traps to my management host, I had to do the following:
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Modify the ArcServe autopilot job to send SNMP traps on job failures, successes, etc.
<li>Edit SYS:\ETC\TRAPTARG.CFG and add the IP address of my management host (the one receiving the SNMP traps)
<li>Load SNMP.NLM
<li>Load ALERT.NLM to facilitate the actual sending of the SNMP traps
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>SNMP Management Host Configuration</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
On my Linux SNMP management host (<b>firestorm</b>), I installed the <a href="http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net">UCD-SNMP</a> (NET-SNMP) software.  Once the software was installed I had to do the following:
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Install the ArcServe MIBs (included on the ArcServe installation CD)
<li>Edit the snmptrapd configuration file <i>(/etc/snmp/snmptrapd.conf)</i> to define a trap handler for ArcServe alerts.  This is detailed below.
<li>Start the <i>snmptrapd</i> daemon to listen for incoming SNMP traps
</ol>
</p>

<p>
In order to have the <i>snmptrapd</i> daemon route ArcServe SNMP traps to our Nagios host, we've got to define a traphandler in the <i>/etc/snmp/snmptrapd.conf</i> file.  In my setup, the config file looked something like this:
</p>

#############################
# ArcServe SNMP Traps

# Tape format failures
traphandle ARCserve-Alarm-MIB::arcServetrap9 /usr/local/nagios/libexec/eventhandlers/handle-arcserve-trap 9

# Failure to read tape header

# Failure to position tape

# Cancelled jobs

# Imcomplete jobs

# Job failures
traphandle ARCserve-Alarm-MIB::arcServetrap15 /usr/local/nagios/libexec/eventhandlers/handle-arcserve-trap 15
</pre>

</p>

<p>
This example assumes that you have a <i>/usr/local/nagios/libexec/eventhandlers/</i> directory on your SNMP mangement host and that the <i>handle-arcserve-trap</i> script exists there.  You can modify these to fit your setup.  Anyway, the <i>handle-arcserve-trap</i> script on my management host looked something like this:
</p>

<p>
<font color="red">
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

# Arguments:
#  $1 = trap type

	# First line passed from snmptrapd is FQDN of host that sent the trap
     read host

    # Given a FQDN, get the short name of the host as it is setup in Nagios
    hostname="unknown"
    case $host in
        novellserver.mylocaldomain.com)
            hostname="novellserver"
            ;;
        nt.mylocaldomain.com)
            hostname="ntserver"
            ;;
	esac
	
    # Get severity level (OK, WARNING, UNKNOWN, or CRITICAL) and plugin output based on trape type
    state=-1
    output="No output"
    case "$1" in

        # failed to format tape - critical
        11)
            output="Critical: Failed to format tape"
            state=2
            ;;

        # failed to read tape header - critical
        10)
            output="Critical: Failed to read tape header"
            state=2
            ;;

        # failed to position tape - critical
        11)
            output="Critical: Failed to position tape"
            state=2
            ;;

        # backup cancelled - warning
        12)
            output="Warning: ArcServe backup operation cancelled"
            state=1
            ;;

        # backup success - ok
        13)
            output="Ok: ArcServe backup operation successful"
            state=0
            ;;

        # backup incomplete - warning
        14)
            output="Warning: ArcServe backup operation incomplete"
            state=1
            ;;

        # backup failure - critical
        15)
            output="Critical: ArcServe backup operation failed"
            state=2
            ;;
    esac


    # Submit passive check result to monitoring host
    /usr/local/nagios/libexec/eventhandlers/submit_check_result $hostname "ArcServe Backup" $state "$output"

exit 0
</pre>
</font>
</p>

<p>
Notice that the <i>handle-arcserve-trap</i> script calls the <i>submit_check_result</i> script to actually send the alert back to the monitoring host.  Assuming your monitoring host is called <b>monitor</b>, the <i>submit check_result</i> script might look like this (you'll have to modify this to specify the proper location of the <i>send_nsca</i> program on your management host):
</p>

<p>
<font color="red">
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

# Arguments
#	$1 = name of host in service definition
#	$2 = name/description of service in service definition
#	$3 = return code
#	$4 = output

/bin/echo -e "$1\t$2\t$3\t$4\n" | /usr/local/nagios/bin/send_nsca monitor -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/send_nsca.cfg
</pre>
</font>
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>Finishing Up</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
You've now configured everything you need to, so all you have to do is restart the Nagios on your monitoring server.  That's it!  You should be getting alerts in Nagios whenever ArcServe jobs fail, succeed, etc.
