#compdef awk

# completions for awk
# This only aims to complete POSIX awk options, as described in
# awk(P). Most awk implementations, such as gawk and mawk, will have
# additional options that this does not complete. Also, currently
# this completion does not allow everything that POSIX allows. For
# example, awk(P) states that the user may specify assignments
# without using the -v option; this does not support that.
#
# In addition, the "program text" completion is not perfect. For
# instance, type "awk -" and then hit tab. You will be presented
# both with the dashed options and with the "program text" option.
# Fixing this is beyond my current _arguments expertise--help
# appreciated.
