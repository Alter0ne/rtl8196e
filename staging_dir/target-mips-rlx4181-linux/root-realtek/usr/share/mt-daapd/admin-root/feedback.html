  This is the version of mt-daapd you are running.  If you are using a 
  public release, use the version number (0.1.0, 0.1.1, etc).  If it is
  manually checked out of cvs, use 'cvs', if it is a nightly snapshot,
  use the snapshot name, for example: 'cvs-20040328'.

  Just for fun, give this release a rating from 1 to 10, 1 being
  so bad it started your computer on fire, 10 meaning works so
  well, it even made your breath fresher.
