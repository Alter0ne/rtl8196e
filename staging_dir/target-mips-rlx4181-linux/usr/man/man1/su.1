.TH SU "1" "October 2013" "util-linux" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
su \- run a command with substitute user and group ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B su
.RI [ options ]
.RB [ \- ]
.RI [ user " [" argument ...]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B su
allows to run commands with a substitute user and group ID.
.PP
When called without arguments,
.B su
defaults to running an interactive shell as
.IR root .
.PP
For backward compatibility
.B su
defaults to not change the current directory and to only set the
environment variables
.B HOME
and
.B SHELL
(plus
.B USER
and
.B LOGNAME
if the target
.I user
is not root).  It is recommended to always use the
.B \-\-login
option (instead of its shortcut
.BR \- )
to avoid side effects caused by mixing environments.
.PP
This version of
.B su
uses PAM for authentication, account and session management.  Some
configuration options found in other
.B su
implementations, such as support of a wheel group, have to be
configured via PAM.

Pass
.I command
to the shell with the
.B \-c

.SH SIGNALS
Upon receiving either
.BR SIGINT ,
.BR SIGQUIT
or
.BR SIGTERM ,
.BR su
terminates its child and afterwards terminates itself with
the received signal.
.SH CONFIG FILES
.B su
reads the
.I /etc/default/su
and
.I /etc/login.defs
configuration files.  The following configuration items are relevant
for
.BR su (1):
.PP
.B FAIL_DELAY
(number)
.RS 4
Delay in seconds in case of authentication failure.  Number must be
a non-negative integer.
.RE
.PP
.B ENV_PATH
(string)
.RS 4
Defines the PATH environment variable for a regular user.  The
default value is
.IR /usr/local/bin:\:/bin:\:/usr/bin .
.RE
.PP
.B ENV_ROOTPATH
(string)
.br
.B ENV_SUPATH
(string)
.RS 4
Defines the PATH environment variable for root.  The default value is
.IR /usr/local/sbin:\:/usr/local/bin:\:/sbin:\:/bin:\:/usr/sbin:\:/usr/bin .
.RE
.PP
.B ALWAYS_SET_PATH
(boolean)
.RS 4
If set to
.I yes
and \-\-login and \-\-preserve\-environment were not specified
.B su
initializes
.BR PATH .
.RE
.SH EXIT STATUS
.B su
normally returns the exit status of the command it executed.  If the
command was killed by a signal,
.B su
returns the number of the signal plus 128.
.PP
Exit status generated by
.B su
itself:
.RS 10
.TP
1
Generic error before executing the requested command
.TP
126
The requested command could not be executed
.TP
127
The requested command could was not found
.RE
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 17
/etc/pam.d/su
default PAM configuration file
.TP
/etc/pam.d/su-l
PAM configuration file if \-\-login is specified
.TP
/etc/default/su
command specific logindef config file
.TP
/etc/login.defs
global logindef config file
.PD 1
.SH NOTES
For security reasons
.B su
always logs failed log-in attempts to the btmp file, but it does not write to
the lastlog file at all.  This solution allows to control
.B su
behavior by PAM configuration.  If you want to use the pam_lastlog module to
print warning message about failed log-in attempts then the pam_lastlog has to
be configured to update lastlog file too. For example by:

.RS
.br
session  required  pam_lastlog.so nowtmp
