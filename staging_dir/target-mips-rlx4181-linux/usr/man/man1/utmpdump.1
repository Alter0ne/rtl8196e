utmpdump \- dump UTMP and WTMP files in raw format
.SH SYNOPSIS
utmpdump [\-frohV] [ filename ]
.SH DESCRIPTION

.SH NOTES
.B utmpdump
can be useful in cases of corrupted utmp or wtmp entries.  It can dump
out utmp/wtmp to an ASCII file, then that file can be edited to remove
bogus entries and reintegrated, using
.PP 
.RS
utmpdump -r < ascii_file > wtmp
.RE
.PP
but be warned as
.B utmpdump
was written for debugging purpose only.
.SH BUGS
You may
.B not
use the option
.B \-r
as the format for the utmp/wtmp files strongly depends on the input
format.  This tool was
.B not
written for normal use but for debugging.
