.TH EXAMPLE "8" "April 2013" "util-linux" "System Administration"
.SH NAME
mkfs.cramfs \- make compressed ROM file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkfs.cramfs
[options]
.I directory file
.SH DESCRIPTION
Files on cramfs file systems are zlib-compressed one page at a time to
allow random read access.  The metadata is not compressed, but is
expressed in a terse representation that is more space-efficient than
conventional file systems.
.PP
The file system is intentionally read-only to simplify its design; random
write access for compressed files is difficult to implement.  cramfs
ships with a utility (mkcramfs) to pack files into new cramfs images.
.PP
File sizes are limited to less than 16MB.
.PP
Maximum file system size is a little under 272MB.  (The last file on the
file system must begin before the 256MB block, but can extend past it.)
.SH ARGUMENTS
The
.I directory
is simply the root of the directory tree that we want to generate a
compressed filesystem out of.
.PP
The
.I file
will contain the cram file system, which later can be mounted.
