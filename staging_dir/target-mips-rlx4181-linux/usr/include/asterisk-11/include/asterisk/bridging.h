/*!
 * \page AstBridging Channel Bridging API
 *
 * The purpose of this API is to provide an easy and flexible way to bridge
 * channels of different technologies with different features.
 *
 * Bridging technologies provide the mechanism that do the actual handling
 * of frames between channels. They provide capability information, codec information,
 * and preference value to assist the bridging core in choosing a bridging technology when
 * creating a bridge. Different bridges may use different bridging technologies based on needs
 * but once chosen they all operate under the same premise; they receive frames and send frames.
 *
 * Bridges are a combination of bridging technology, channels, and features. A
 * developer creates a new bridge based on what they are currently expecting to do
 * with it or what they will do with it in the future. The bridging core determines what
 * available bridging technology will best fit the requirements and creates a new bridge.
 * Once created, channels can be added to the bridge in a blocking or non-blocking fashion.
 *
 * Features are such things as channel muting or DTMF based features such as attended transfer,
 * blind transfer, and hangup. Feature information must be set at the most granular level, on
 * the channel. While you can use features on a global scope the presence of a feature structure
 * on the channel will override the global scope. An example would be having the bridge muted
 * at global scope and attended transfer enabled on a channel. Since the channel itself is not muted
 * it would be able to speak.
 *
 * Feature hooks allow a developer to tell the bridging core that when a DTMF string
 * is received from a channel a callback should be called in their application. For
 * example, a conference bridge application may want to provide an IVR to control various
 * settings on the conference bridge. This can be accomplished by attaching a feature hook
 * that calls an IVR function when a DTMF string is entered.
