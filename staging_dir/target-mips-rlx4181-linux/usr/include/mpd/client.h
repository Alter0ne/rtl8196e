 * \brief MPD client library
 *
 * This is a client library for the Music Player Daemon, written in C.
 *
 * You can choose one of several APIs, depending on your requirements:
 *
 * - struct mpd_async: a very low-level asynchronous API which knows
 *   the protocol syntax, but no specific commands
 *
 * - struct mpd_connection: a basic synchronous API which knows all
 *   MPD commands and parses all responses
 *
